# POLE CHUDES (1992–1993) — reverse-engineered source code

**Reverse-engineered reconstruction of the original DOS game «Поле чудес» by Vadim Bashurov (Arzamas-16, 1992–1993).**

**This copy is the MAT version («версия с матами», 1993)**: all phrases were recovered byte-for-byte from the hacked `POLE_MAT/POLE.EXE`. The mat hack was made by **Sergei Rasskazov** (school No. 855) — per the credits embedded in the binary: «Сделал Дима Башуров из Арзамаса-16 а исправил Сергей Рассказов», «Переделал Сергей Рассказов из школы номер 855.»

The source code was recovered by reverse engineering the original `POLE.EXE`. The reconstruction preserves the original program structure, procedures, variables, algorithms and formulas, and is written in **Turbo Pascal 7.0** for MS-DOS.

The original program was written for DOS. This reconstruction works in DOS or in an emulator. It uses VGA mode `10h` (640×350×16), direct access to video memory at `$A000`, and does **not** use Crt, Graph or BGI units.

## Requirements

The game runs **only under MS-DOS** (or a DOS emulator such as DOSBox). This is not a port to a modern operating system.

The reconstructed code retains direct interaction with IBM PC hardware:

- VGA mode `$10` (640×350×16);
- direct access to video memory at `$A000`;
- BIOS `INT 10h` services;
- keyboard via BIOS `INT 16h`;
- mouse support via `INT 33h`;
- PC speaker sound via ports `$42` / `$61`;
- the data files `POLE.LIB`, `POLE.FNT`, `POLE.OVL` and `POLE.PIC` placed next to the executable.

## Building and running

### DOSBox + Turbo Pascal 7

Install DOSBox (or DOSBox-X / DOSBox Staging) and Turbo Pascal 7.0, then compile the reconstructed source. Place `POLE.LIB`, `POLE.FNT`, `POLE.OVL` and `POLE.PIC` in the same directory as the resulting `EXE`.
